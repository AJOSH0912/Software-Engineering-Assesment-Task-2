This online store is built to show the simplicity of online shopping. This code is quite user-friendly and does not need any instructions to manage. The code is quite clear and needs minimal understanding since it uses functions to navigate screens and classes to hold values. Overall, a small inconvenience is that the words shift a couple of pixels throughout different pages, though does not affect usability.
